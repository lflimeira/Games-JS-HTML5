# Games (JS + HTML5)
Games that I developed using JavaScript and HTML5.

## Installation

You don't have to install anything, you just have to download the game's file that you want to play and open it using your browser.


## Pong

Pong is one of the earliest arcade video games and the very first sports arcade video game. It is a table tennis sports game featuring simple two-dimensional graphics.

### Controls

- **Player 1**: arrow keys (up, down).
- **Player 2**: "w" to up, "s" to down.
